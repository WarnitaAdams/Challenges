    <h1>Maxims of Baloo</h1>
    <p>All that is told here happened some time before<br>
      Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or<br>
      revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the<br>
      days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the<br> Jungle.</p><br>

  <p>The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so<br>
  quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as<br>
  much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own<br>
  pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat<br>
  the Hunting Verse —‘Feet that make no noise; eyes that<br>
  can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their<br>
  lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks<br>
  of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena<br>
  whom we hate.’ But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a<br>
  great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black<br>
  Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see<br>
  how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head<br>
  against a tree while Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to<br>
  Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could<br>
  swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo<br>
  the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water<br>

  Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how<br>
  to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a<br>
  hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang<br>
  the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday;<br>
  and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he<br>
  splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People<br>
  like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an<br>
  intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’<br>
  Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is<br>
  answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts<br>
  outside his own grounds. It means, translated, ‘Give me<br>
  leave to hunt here because I am hungry.’ And the answer<br>
  is, ‘Hunt then for food, but not for pleasure.’</p><br>

  <p>All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn<br>
  by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing<br>
  over a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one<br>
  day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a<br>
  temper, ‘A man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all<br>
  the Law of the Jungle.’<br>
  ‘But think how small he is,’ said the Black Panther,<br>
  who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own<br>
  way. ‘How can his little head carry all thy long talk?’<br>

  <p>‘Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed?<br>
  No. That is why I teach him these things, and that is why<br>
  I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.’</p><br>
  <p>‘Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Ironfeet?’<br>
  Bagheera grunted. ‘His face is all bruised today by<br>
  thy— softness. Ugh.’</p><br>
  <p><h2>‘Better he should</h2> be bruised from head to foot by me<br>
  who love him than that he should come to harm through<br>
  ignorance,’ Baloo answered very earnestly. ‘I am now<br>
  teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall<br>
  protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all<br>
  that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now<br>
  claim protection, if he will only remember the words,<br>
  from all in the jungle. Is not that worth a little beating?’</p><br>
  <p>‘Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the mancub.<br>
  He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon.<br>
  But what are those Master Words? I am more likely to<br>
  give help than to ask it’ —Bagheera stretched out one paw<br>
  and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end<br>
  of it—‘still I should like to know.’</p><br>
  <p>‘I will call Mowgli and he shall say them—if he will.<br>
  Come, Little Brother!’</p><br>
  <p>‘My head is ringing like a bee tree,’ said a sullen little<br>
  voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk<br>

  very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the<br>
  ground: ‘I come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat old<br>
  Baloo!’</p><br>
  <p>‘That is all one to me,’ said Baloo, though he was hurt<br>
  and grieved. ‘Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of<br>
  the Jungle that I have taught thee this day.’</p><br>
  <p>‘Master Words for which people?’ said Mowgli,<br>
  delighted to show off. ‘The jungle has many tongues. I<br>
  know them all.’</p><br>
  <p><h2>‘A little thou</h2> knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera,<br>
  they never thank their teacher. Not one small wolfling has<br>
  ever come back to thank old Baloo for his teachings. Say<br>
  the word for the Hunting-People, then—great scholar.’</p><br>
  <p>‘We be of one blood, ye and I,’ said Mowgli, giving<br>
  the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting People<br>
  use.</p><br>
  <p>‘Good. Now for the birds.’</p><br>
  <p>Mowgli repeated, with the Kite’s whistle at the end of<br>
  the sentence.</p><br>
  <p>‘Now for the Snake-People,’ said Bagheera.</p>
  <p>The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and<br>
  Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands<br>
  together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheera’s<br>
  back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on<br>

  the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think<br>
  of at Baloo.</p><br>
  <p><h2>‘There—there! That</h2> was worth a little bruise,’ said the<br>
  brown bear tenderly. ‘Some day thou wilt remember me.’<br>
  Then he turned aside to tell Bagheera how he had begged<br>
  the Master Words from Hathi the Wild Elephant, who<br>
  knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken<br>
  Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a<br>
  water-snake, because Baloo could not pronounce it, and<br>
  how Mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents<br>
  in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor beast would<br>
  hurt him.</p><br>
  <p>‘No one then is to be feared,’ Baloo wound up, patting<br>
  his big furry stomach with pride.</p><br>
  <p>‘Except his own tribe,’ said Bagheera, under his breath;<br>
  and then aloud to Mowgli, ‘Have a care for my ribs, Little<br>
  Brother! What is all this dancing up and down?’</p><br>
  <p>Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by<br>
  pulling at Bagheera’s shoulder fur and kicking hard. When<br>
  the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his<br>
  voice, ‘And so I shall have a tribe of my own, and lead<br>
  them through the branches all day long.’</p><br>
  <p>‘What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?’ said<br>
  Bagheera.</p><br>

<p>‘Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,’<br>
  Mowgli went on. ‘They have promised me this. Ah!’</p><br>
  <p><h2>‘Whoof!’ Baloo’s big</h2> paw scooped Mowgli off<br>
  Bagheera’s back, and as the boy lay between the big forepaws<br>
  he could see the Bear was angry.</p><br>
  <p>‘Mowgli,’ said Baloo, ‘thou hast been talking with the<br>
  Bandar-log—the Monkey People.’</p><br>
<p>  Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was<br>
  angry too, and Bagheera’s eyes were as hard as jade stones.</p><br>
  <p>‘Thou hast been with the Monkey People—the gray<br>
  apes—the people without a law—the eaters of everything.<br>
  That is great shame.’</p><br>
  <p>‘When Baloo hurt my head,’ said Mowgli (he was still<br>
  on his back), ‘I went away, and the gray apes came down<br>
  from the trees and had pity on me. No one else cared.’ He<br>
  snuffled a little.</p><br>
  <p>‘The pity of the Monkey People!’ Baloo snorted. ‘The<br>
  stillness of the mountain stream! The cool of the summer<br>
  sun! And then, man-cub?’</p><br>
  <p><h2>‘And then, and</h2> then, they gave me nuts and pleasant<br>
  things to eat, and they—they carried me in their arms up<br>
  to the top of the trees and said I was their blood brother<br>
  except that I had no tail, and should be their leader some<br>
  day.’</p><br>
