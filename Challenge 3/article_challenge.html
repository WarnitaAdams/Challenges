    <h1>Sorry, Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your Kids <br> From Tech Addiction</h1>

<p>We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen time. <br> The answers were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful.</p>

<p>“I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as<br> is my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies. No t<br> wanting to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, <br> holds it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone. It is the <br> cutest/most pathetic thing.”</p>

<p>That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her small <br> child’s burgeoning tech addiction. Like most parents, that mom lives a <br> waking life seeped in almost non-stop screen time (an average <br> American adult spends about 11 hours a day looking at a screen). She, <br> like many modern parents, sees her own tech dependency reflected in <br> her children’s habits. She doesn’t always like what she sees.</p>

<p>Even as we learn about the potential pitfalls of our increasingly <br> technology-addled lifestyles, our dependence on tech shows little sign <br> of waning. Still, the anti-screen time drumbeat is getting louder, <br> especially when it comes to kids.</p>

<p>In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an <br> early employee at Facebook, said that the social network was “ripping <br> apart the social fabric of how society works.” Tristan Harris, a former <br> product manager at Google, told Wired that Apple, Google, Facebook, <br> Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time <br> and attention. In January, two Apple investors asked the company to <br> study the health effects of its products on children.</p>

<p>Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from <br> some the most powerful tech companies–including Apple, Google, and <br> Facebook–formed the Center for Humane Technology. In partnership <br> with the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, the <br> group plans to lobby against addictive tech, and is kicking off with a $7 <br> million “Truth about Tech” ad campaign that they plan to deliver to <br> 55,000 public schools.</p>

<p>That the very people who championed the technology to which we are <br> addicted are now banding together to warn parents about the monster <br> they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to <br> question tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that <br> an ad campaign, no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail <br> our society’s addiction–especially when kids these days <br> are being introduced to screens at such a young age. In her book, The Art of Screen <br> Time Anya Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-<br>year-olds) that found that young kids spend about four hours a day in <br> the company of (all types of) screens.</p>

<p>To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast <br> Company surveyed nearly 400 parents. We tried to look at the issue from <br> all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types <br> of devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of <br> technology, to the benefits that technology can provide to families. We <br> also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own tech <br> addiction reflected in their kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the <br> most telling answers of all.</p>

<p>The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a <br> few other countries). Their professions span many industries, including <br> marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video <br> production, law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or <br> two children, ranging from 7 months to 18 years old. The majority of <br> participants’ kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these <br> parents are in the thick of parenting.</p>

<p>Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers isn’t a <br> conclusive sample–but, along with expert research, these parents’ <br> insights help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents in <br> our tech-dependent era.</p>
